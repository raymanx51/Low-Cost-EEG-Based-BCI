 # Low Cost EEG Electrodes

EEG Cup electrodes can be very expensive (>â‚¬10 per lead) in terms of an low cost project, so I decided to make my own. I made mine using a standard ECG pad electrode, a rubber shower hose washer (inner diameter of 10mm) and a 13mm metal button snap. I also made some ear clips electrodes using the EEG cup electrodes and a clothes peg.

Below is two of the DIY low cost EEG cups and a standard ECG Pad

Below are pictures of low cost ear clip electrodes using the same electrodes from above

## Instructions to make electrodes
### EEG Cup Electrode
1. Remove the gel from an ECG pad electrode
2. Cut out the center of an ECG pad electrode around the area of the gel 
3. Apply superglue to the around area the electrodes
4. Carefully place the rubber shower hose washer on the electrode and leave to dry
5. (Optional) apply superglue to the top side of the cup (not on the metal)
6. Wrap some multi stranded wire around one of the holes in the metal button snap and solder it

### Ear Clip Electrode
1. Follow the steps above for making the EEG Cup electrodes
2. Drill a hole on one side of the clothes peg for the top of electrode to protrude
3. Smooth down the inside of the peg so that the electrode can lie flat
4. Wrap a stranded wire tightly around the top of the electrodes
5. Apply a lot of solder to the wire to insure there is a good connection, I was not able to solder to the electrode directly
6. Pull the wire through the peg hole and push the top of the electrode through the hole as well
7. Glue the electrode in place
8. Glue a second rubber shower hose washer to the other side of the peg to act as a cushion

## Attaching the EEG Cup Electrodes
1. I applied abrasive gel (Nuprep) to the area I was going to attach the electrode. This should reduce the electrode-skin impedance and should improve the signal quality. I haven't tested the signal quality without using the gel.
2. Fill the EEG cup with gel (I used Signa conductive electrode gel).
3. Place the electrode to the area you wish to measure.
4. I held the electrodes in place with a swimming cap, but this can be difficult to do for multiple electrodes on different parts of the scalp.
